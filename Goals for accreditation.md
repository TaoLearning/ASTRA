### **Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Lack of Specificity on HLC Criteria:**
   - The plan does not explicitly address how Hackney University will meet each of HLC's **five Criteria for Accreditation**:
     - **Criterion 1:** Mission
     - **Criterion 2:** Integrity: Ethical and Responsible Conduct
     - **Criterion 3:** Teaching and Learning: Quality, Resources, and Support
     - **Criterion 4:** Teaching and Learning: Evaluation and Improvement
     - **Criterion 5:** Resources, Planning, and Institutional Effectiveness
   - The plan should include specific actions and evidence for each criterion.

2. **Insufficient Detail on Financial and Governance Audits:**
   - While internal audits are mentioned, there is no detail on how financial stability and governance structures will be evaluated and improved to meet HLC standards.
   - HLC requires documented evidence of financial health and effective governance.

3. **Student Success Metrics:**

   - HLC requires evidence of student learning outcomes and support services.

4. **Faculty and Staff Qualifications:**
   - The plan does not detail how faculty and staff qualifications will be verified and documented to meet HLC standards.
   - HLC requires evidence that all faculty and staff meet the necessary credentials and training requirements.

5. **Stakeholder Engagement:**
   - The plan does not explicitly address how students, alumni, and external stakeholders will be involved in the accreditation process.
   - HLC values evidence of broad stakeholder engagement in institutional planning and improvement.

The plan should be revised to explicitly address each of HLC's five criteria and provide comprehensive documentation of institutional effectiveness.

If these improvements are made, the plan is likely to be approved by HLC, and Hackney University will be well-positioned to achieve accreditation.
